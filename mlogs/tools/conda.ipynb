    "1. Environment Manager \n",
    "    Every project has it's own dependencies. One project might use Tensorflow and another might use XGBoost. There is no reason why these two project should be in the same enviroment. Conda lets you create different enviroments for every project ( or every type of project )\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Share your environments\n",
    "    If you are working with a team, it is essentials that you develop on the same enviroment so as to avoid dependency issues. You would not only be tracking your python package dependencies but also python version itself. This sharing also applied to building projects in production, which can use the same enviroment. \n",
